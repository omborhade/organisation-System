I developed the backend for an Organization Management System using Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and RESTful APIs. 
In this project,I maintained relationships between entities using mappings, ensuring seamless interaction between data models. 🌐

Key Features:

Get Employee by Status 📊: Retrieve employees based on their status.
Get Employee by Salary 💰: Fetch employees according to their salary.
Login API 🔐: Secure employee login functionality.
Manage Employees 🧑‍💼: Add, Update, Get, and Delete employee records.
Manage Countries 🌍: Add, Update, Get, and Delete country records.
Additionally, I utilized the Lombok library to reduce boilerplate code, making the codebase cleaner and more efficient. 🧹✨

This project demonstrates efficient database interactions and robust API implementations, providing effective management of organizational data.
